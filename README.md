🎬 **F.R.I.E.N.D.S** Episode Dashboard in Excel 🎯
I recently built an interactive dashboard in Excel — based on the iconic TV show Friends.
 It helped me strengthen my Excel skills and have fun with data at the same time!
✨ Features:
 ✅ Dynamic KPIs – Max Votes, Average Rating, Most & Least Liked Episodes
 ✅ Slicers for Season and Episode selection
 ✅ Title that updates based on slicer selection
 ✅ Clean layout with charts and conditional formatting
🛠️ Tools Used:
“**Pivot! PIVOT! PIVOT!**” – Ross 😄
 (Yes, I actually used Pivot Tables here!)
